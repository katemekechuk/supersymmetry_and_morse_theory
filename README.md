# supersymmetry_and_morse_theory
June 2024 â€“ August 2024, Barnard Summer Research Institute

This repository is dedicated to the work I completed with Professor Konstantin Aleshkin (now in Japan) during the spring and summer of 2024. In this repository is a poster for the Barnard SRI 2024 Poster Session.

Although still incomplete at the time I am writing this, I hope to upload the following into this repository:
  1.  In depth paper about the mathematical and physical approaches to Morse theory
  2.  Paper deriving the genus formula using Morse theory (possible connecting this to supersymmetry too)
