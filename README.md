# supersymmetry_and_morse_theory
June 2024 â€“ August 2024, Barnard Summer Research Institute

This repository is dedicated to the work I completed with Professor Konstantin Aleshkin (now in Japan) during the spring and summer of 2024. Although still incomplete at the time I am writing this, I hope to upload the following into this repository:
  1.  Barnard SRI Poster 2024
  2.  In depth paper about the mathematical and physical approaches to Morse theory
  3.  Paper deriving the genus formula using Morse theory (possible connecting this to supersymmetry too)
